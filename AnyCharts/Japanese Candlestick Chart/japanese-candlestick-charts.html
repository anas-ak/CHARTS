            <p>
                A Japanese candlestick chart is a combination of a line and bar chart used to describe price movements of an equity over time, where each bar represents the range of price movement over a given time interval. It is mostly used in technical analysis of equity and currency price patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Candlesticks consist of the body (black or white) and an upper and a lower shadow (wick). The wick illustrates the highest and lowest traded prices of a stock, and the body represents the opening and closing trades. If the stock went up, the body is white, with the opening price at the bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. If the stock went down, the body is black, with the opening price at the top and the closing price at the bottom. It is not necessary for a candlestick to have either a body or a wick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some traders find candlestick charts easier to read than OHLC charts. Japanese candlestick is a series type that is predominantly used for demonstrating the stock market data, due to its specifics.

                    <li>
                        fallingFill() and risingFill() to set the fill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fallingHatchFill() and risingHatchFill() to set the hatch fill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        fallingStroke() and risingStroke() to set the stroke
                    </li>

            <h4>Point Size</h4>
            <p>This chart allows you to set up the size of its points.</p>

            <h4>Labels</h4>
            <p>
                Labels are text or image elements that can be placed anywhere on any chart (they can be on a whole series or for a single point). 
            </p>
            
            <h4>Tooltips</h4>
            <p>
                A Tooltip is a text box displayed when a point on a chart is hovered over.  There is a number of visual and other settings available: for example, you can edit the text by using font settings and text formatters, change the style of background, adjust the position of a tooltip, and so on.

        <h4>Candlestick Patterns</h4>
        <p>
            In technical analysis, a candlestick pattern is a movement in prices shown graphically on a candlestick chart. Some believe that it can predict a particular market movement. The recognition of the pattern is subjective, and charting programs have to rely on predefined rules to match the pattern. There are 42 recognized patterns, which can be divided into two groups: simple and complex.
        </p>
        <p>Here are the most popular simple patterns, shown in the sample below:</p>

                <td>The close price is lower than the open price, and both are lower that the high price and upper than the low price. The difference between the values is not significant.</td>
