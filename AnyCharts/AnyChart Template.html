            <p>
                A Bullet Chart is a variation of Bar Chart designed to compare a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue) to one or more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target), and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as poor, satisfactory, and good. The qualitative ranges are displayed as blocks of one hue but with varying intensity, making them discernible by those who are color blind and to restrict the use of colors on the dashboard to a minimum.

Gauge axes are usually colored for easy value distinction. Gauges can be used as clocks, speedometer, compass, volume tuner or any other gauge that should represent the value as an angle on a circle plot.

            <h5>Pareto Chart</h5>
            <p>
                A module for creating Pareto Charts. <br>
                A Pareto chart, named after Vilfredo Pareto, is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line.

                The left vertical axis is the frequency of occurrence, but it can alternatively represent cost or another important unit of measure. The right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences, total cost, or total of the particular unit of measure. Because the reasons are in decreasing order, the cumulative function is a concave function.

                The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on.

            <h5>PERT Chart</h5>
            <p>
                A module for creating PERT Charts. <br>
                PERT is an abbreviation for "Program (Project) Evaluation and Review Technique". This technique, developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, is used in project management to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. It is applied mostly in large-scale projects where time is the major factor and allows to schedule a project without knowing precisely the details and durations of all activities. For example, PERT was used in planning the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble.
                <br><br>
                Despite PERT technology might seem too complicated, it can still be profitably applied and used in some circumstances. For example, planning a building project can be successfully based on the PERT method. Similarly, the organization of any examinations or competitions, especially on a national scale, due to being complicated and expensive, is worth being based on PERT. Any reforms, innovations or other activities which demand a great time and resource planning are good cases for using PERT.

            <h5>Pie Charts</h5>
            <p>
                A module for creating Pie Charts. <br>
                A pie chart is a circular chart looking like a pie divided into slices (sectors). Slices show the percentage each value contributes to a total, the area of each slice being proportional to the quantity it represents, and the circle representing 100%.
                Pie charts are used very widely with small sets of data to compare categories. They cannot be multiple-series and should not be used when there are more than just a few categories.

                A doughnut (or donut) chart is a pie chart with a "hole" - a blank circular area in the center. The chart is divided into parts that show the percentage each value contributes to a total.

                Like the regular pie chart, the doughnut chart is used with small sets of data to compare categories. It drives attention from the area taken by each part to emphasize the length of arcs. The blank space also allows displaying some additional information in the center: for example, labels, the name of a selected category, or the chart title.

                A module for creating Scatter Plots. <br>
                AnyChart allows you to create scatter charts by using a special scatter chart constructor. It processes data points as-is: sets of arguments from different series don't influence each other, points are shown in the exact order they are set, and lines can be vertical and cross themselves. While the Cartesian constructor distributes points along the X-axis at equal intervals (categories), the scatter constructor distributes points according to their values. Scatter charts are used mainly to visualize the results of mathematical calculations or physics experiments.

            <p>
                A module for creating Sparkline charts. <br>
                In some cases it might be necessary to represent a lot of similar data over a long period of time, such as currency trends. Up and down arrows are used for this purpose quite often, but they cannot give the whole picture of the trends. That's where sparklines come to the fore.

                Sparkline charts are rather small with neither axes nor grids, amount of additional information is minimized, but they tell a richer story than trend arrows: we can make a chart display not just the current situation, but its changing over time. Sometimes sparklines can be even more informative than any of usual chart types - just because of its simplicity.

                A module for creating Stock charts. <br>
                Stock Chart is a special type of charts that can effectively visualize great amount of date time based data. It has lots of special features such as zoom with Scroller UI, synchronized plots, data grouping and so on. Moreover, Stock Charts are very useful for real-time data visualization. Use them when you have a large amount of date time based data; so it's quite logical to use them, for example, not only for showing the company assets and earnings, but also such things as changes of gage height and water discharge in a Water Supply District for the last decade. That's what makes AnyStock are this popular: it can show large amounts of data and keep it clear to the audience.

                A word tree is a visualization that displays text data in a hierarchical way: as a tree of elements, usually single words, connected by lines. The font size of words represents their weight - the frequency / number of children. This type can be used to show typical contexts a root word appears in or a hierarchy of terms.

                A sunburst chart, otherwise known as a radial treemap or multi-level pie chart, is a visualization that displays hierarchically organized data as a set of nested rings (the top level of the hierarchy is shown in the center). Rings are divided into slices that represent data points, the sizes of slices sometimes representing their values.

This chart is typically used to show keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag, which is often based on its frequency, is shown with font size or color.

                A Venn diagram, named after John Venn, is a diagram representing all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. Sets are shown as regions inside circles or other closed curves, and common elements of the sets are shown as intersections of these circles.

                The AnyChart Venn chart type can be also used for creating Euler diagrams. The Euler diagram, named after Leonhard Euler, is very similar to the Venn diagram, but represents only relevant relations between sets.

                A waterfall chart is a data visualization that shows how an initial value is affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative values. This type is otherwise known as a cascade chart, bridge chart, flying bricks chart, or Mario chart.

                As a rule, intermediate values are visualized as floating columns, while the initial and the final values look like whole columns. The elements are usually connected with lines.
